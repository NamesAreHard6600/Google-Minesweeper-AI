Didn't start patch notes until 1.2.0
1.2.0:
Added a requirements text file so that's not a pain. 
Added support for medium difficutly. Basically just adding colors. Change it by changing the "difficulty" variable
Added support for easy difficulty. Same as medium.
Turned back on the difficulty selector at the start of the program.
