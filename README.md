# Minesweeper AI: V-1.2.0
Hey! This code is designed to play and solve minesweeper, specfically google minesweeper. This version works about 90% of the time. It misses some logic sometimes, it bugs out other times, but overall, it works and solves minesweeper. 
I do plan on updating more though.  

## How to Use it
Install python and the requirements in the requirements.txt `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Make sure zoom is 100%
Make sure minesweeper is in the first monitor/main screen and the cmd line doesn't block the screenshot
HOLD DOWN Q TO SHUT IT OFF. You may need to for a few seconds but it will shut off. 
It should automatically find the board on its own, so feel free to set the command line off to the side if you want. The command line does print stuff out so you can see kinda what's going on, but it doesn't really slow it down because the animations in google minesweeper are the slowest part, so you can comment those lines out if you really want that extra .1 second, if even. Just ctrl+f "print" and comment out any  lines that aren't already, including myGame.printBoard(). Also, it may seem like it's freaking out when it says UNKNOWN COLOR but 99% of those are expected so don't worry about it.

## TO DO:
